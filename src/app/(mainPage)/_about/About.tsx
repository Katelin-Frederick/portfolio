    <p className='md:text-xl'>
      My name is Katelin Frederick and I&apos;m a full-stack web developer who is passionate about to creating and building applications from the ground up. I&apos;m driven by the challenge of turning ideas into robust, functional, user-friendly applications. I&apos;ve been professionally involved in the web development industry since 2019.

    <br />

    <p className='md:text-xl'>
      My specialties include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Git, with a strong focus on React.js and Next.js for front-end development. On the back end, I work with Node.js and have experience leveraging serverless architecture using AWS to build scalable  and cost-effective applications. The AWS resources I&apos;m most familiar with include S3, DynamoDB, APIGateway, Lambda, and CloudWatch. Though these are the skills I use the most and am most familiar with, I always love learning new things.

      Throughout my career, I&apos;ve worked on a variety of projects mostly entailing the development of online forms and building interactive calculator applications.

Attention to detail is something I take pride in, whether it&apos;s in writing clean, efficient code or ensuring seamless design integration.

      I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work in agile teams, collaborating closely with colleagues across different disciplines to deliver iterative, high-quality products. I enjoy the dynamic nature of agile workflows and the opportunity to continuously improve and adapt to feedback.

      In addition to coding, I&apos;m deeply passionate about teaching and mentoring others. Helping fellow developers grow in their careers and sharing knowledge is something I find incredibly rewarding. I believe that the tech community thrives when we support and uplift one another.
