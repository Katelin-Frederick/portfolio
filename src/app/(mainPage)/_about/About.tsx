      Hello ðŸ‘‹! My name is Katelin Frederick and I am a full-stack web developer with over 5 years of experience. I specialize in tools including React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS resources such as S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB. I have worked on agile teams building serverless web applications consisting of user forms and admin dashboards hosted using AWS.

      I thoroughly enjoy learning new processes and tools to keep up with industry standards and grow my skill
      set. In addition to coding, I enjoy helping other developers learn and grow in their careers. I have strong
      communication, documentation, analytical, and critical thinking skills.
