    <p className='md:text-xl'>
      I&apos;m Katelin Frederick, an experienced full-stack engineer who builds and ships
      production-grade web applications. My core stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js, with
      hands-on experience in serverless architecture on AWS.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p className='md:text-xl'>
      I&apos;m drawn to the full picture — understanding a problem deeply, then solving it across the entire
      stack. I&apos;ve also developed a genuine passion for mentoring, supporting junior and mid-level engineers
      through code reviews, technical guidance, and career development. I believe the best engineering teams
      are ones where technical excellence and investing in the people around you go hand in hand.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p className='md:text-xl'>
      I came to development through self-teaching — driven by curiosity and the satisfaction of building
      something from nothing. That same drive is still with me today, whether I&apos;m picking up a new tool,
      digging into an unfamiliar part of the stack, or helping someone else have that &quot;it works!&quot; moment
      for the first time.
