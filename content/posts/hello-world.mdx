Every developer portfolio starts with a "hello world" post. Here's mine.

## The Stack

I built this site with:

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) — React Server Components make it easy to fetch content at the server without shipping extra JavaScript to the browser
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — utility-first styling that stays out of the way
- **shadcn/ui** — accessible, unstyled components I can actually customize
- **next-mdx-remote** — renders MDX from any source, local files today, maybe a remote API tomorrow

## Why MDX for the Blog?

I wanted posts to live alongside my code in version control. MDX gives me the full power of Markdown with the option to drop in React components when I need them.

The content layer is abstracted behind a simple API:

```typescript
const posts = await getAllPosts()
const post = await getPostBySlug('hello-world')
```

When my post count grows and I want to move them out of the repo, I only need to change the implementation — not a single page or component.

## What I'll Write About

Mostly things I'm working through day-to-day:

- Full-stack patterns I find useful
- Things that took me longer than they should have
- Side projects and what I learned building them

If any of that sounds useful, stick around.
